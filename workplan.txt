Our task list & workplan

Important Note: Jen will be MIA Thursday-Sunday.

Already done:
	-basic code (by Jen) running finite difference
	-added an energy calculation (Anna, in class)
	-fix energy function (Andrew-done)
	-rewrite A matrix to include potential (Anna-DONE)
	-periodic boundary condition case! A matrix must be rewritten (Anna-Done)
	-We need to implement the other scheme (Andrew)
	-got free particle example running, but outputs are no good 
	-function that defines initial position grid (Andrew) based on a function
	-Troubleshoot free particle example
	-check links between existing components so that runs actually work (best done together?)
	-function that creates potential grid based on list of preset options (Jen)
	-Set up output files/folder (Jen)
	-code that runs everything (Jen)
	-troubleshoot b matrix in new scheme (andrew)
	-set up rest of potentials
	-figure out barrier error
	-output potentials to overlay on charts (anna)
	-get rest of visualizations up and running (anna)
	-analytical solution to square well was added (anna)
	-analytical solution to harmonic oscilator (anna)
	-comment python code (Anna)
	-fix eigenstate solver (HARD. Nope. Not at all hard. Reading
	data into mathematica file wrong :( anna fixed it. )

To do: 
       -readme file




What runs will we do?
     Free particle: periodic (which should look sensible) and non periodic (which won't)
     Square well (non periodic, force the wave function to be zero )
     Harmonic oscillator (non periodic)
     Barrier (non-periodic, grid size large compared to barrier width is needed)
     	     height = E, height < E, height > E 
     Triangle (non-periodic)
     Kronig-Penney crystal (perodic)
     V=ix in an 2L box (non-periodic)
     V=ix+x in a 2L box (non-perodic)
