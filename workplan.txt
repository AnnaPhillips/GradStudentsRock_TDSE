Our task list & workplan

Important Note: Jen will be MIA Thursday-Sunday.

Already done:
	-basic code (by Jen) running finite difference
	-added an energy calculation (in class)
	-fix energy function (Andrew-done)
	-rewrite A matrix to include potential (Anna-DONE)
	-periodic boundary condition case! A matrix must be rewritten (Anna-Done)
	-Write up an eigen-function finder (Anna did while together)
	-Set up output files/folder (Jen)


To do: 
   -function that defines initial position grid (Andrew) based on a function
   -function that creates potential grid based on list of preset options (Jen will start, make a class, grid points, and domain length)
   -We need to implement the other scheme (Andrew)


What runs will we do?
     Free particle: periodic (which should look sensible) and non periodic (which won't)
     Square well (non periodic, force the wave function to be zero )
     Harmonic oscillator (non periodic)
     Barrier (non-periodic, grid size large compared to barrier width is needed)
     	     height = E, height < E, height > E 
     Triangle (non-periodic)
     Kronig-Penney crystal (perodic)
     V=ix in an 2L box (non-periodic)
     V=ix+x in a 2L box (non-perodic)
