# The Time Dependent Schroedinger Equation
### Computational Physics -- Tufts University, Sprint 2015
### Andrew DeBendedictis, Anna Phillips, & Jennifer Radoff

#### Overview
This program runs simulations of the time dependent schroedinger equation for different potentials. This program runs a simple finite difference scheme and the Crank-Nicolson scheme. It also runs for either periodic or non-periodic boundary conditions. It runs 8 different potential conditions: zero potential (free particle), square well, harmonic oscillator, triangle, Kronig-Penney, barrier,
